# BleedingFixer-Aseprite-Love2d
A simple script for Aseprite used to add borders to individual tiles in a tileset. <br />
Useful for fixing the bleeding problem in Love2d.<br />

Last tested with Aseprite v1.2.16 <br />

## Installation
1. go to `file --> scripts --> (open scripts folder)` <br />
2. copy the script file `bleedingFixerLove2d.lua` there. <br />

## Usage
1. SAVE YOUR WORK. SAVE YOUR WORK. SAVE YOUR WORK.<br />
This script may crush Aseprite or irreversibly mess up your art.<br />

2. Open the tileset and go to `file --> scripts --> bleedingFixerLove2d`. <br />
3. Set your tile width and height and preferably check "Same color". <br />
4. Export your tileset as you would normally.<br />
5. Press `Ctrl+Z` to restore your original tileset.<br />
